## Introduction
The object of a MicroMouse is to navigate and solve a 16x16 maze as fast as possible.

As a part of the University at Buffalo's IEEE club, we designed, built, and programmed this MicroMouse from scratch to compete in IEEE Region 1 & 2 MicroMouse competitions.

Every aspect of this MicroMouse was custom designed. This reposity contains all design files and code for the MicroMouse.
